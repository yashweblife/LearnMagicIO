                <h4>The Physics Point Of View</h4>
                <p>
                    <b>Gravity</b> is a force of attraction that exists between any two masses, any two bodies, any two particles. 
                    <b>Gravity</b> is not just the attraction between objects and the Earth. It is an attraction that exists 
                    between all objects, everywhere in the universe.               
                </p>
                <h3>Foundation:</h3>
                <p>
                    Earth's gravity comes from all its mass. All its mass makes a combined gravitational pull on all 
                    the mass in your body. That's what gives you weight. And if you were on a planet with less mass than 
                    Earth, you would weigh less than you do here.
